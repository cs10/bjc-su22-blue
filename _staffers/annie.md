Hi! My name is Annie, and I am a 3rd year studying environmental sciences and data science. I took CS10 my second semester at Cal and have been with CS10 ever since, as an AI and now a reader. I love taking long walks, reading mystery novels, listening to music and podcasts, and baking. I am super excited to be with CS10 this semester and hope you love it as much as I do!
