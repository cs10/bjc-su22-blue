Hi!! I’m Deeksha and I’m from a small town in Iowa. I took CS10 my freshman fall semester without any coding experience and now I’m a fourth-year CS major! Outside of school you might find me at rehearsal for the Indian dance team I’m on at Cal, rewatching Friends for the 10th time, enjoying Berkeley Thai food, or attempting to learn guitar. Teaching is a huge passion of mine which is why I love being a part of CS10 course staff. I’m so excited to meet you all this semester and help you have an amazing experience in this course!
