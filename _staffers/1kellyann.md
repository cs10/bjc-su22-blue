Hi hi! Iâ€™m Kellyann, a senior studying CS and theater management! Like most of the staff, I had never programmed before college and took CS10 before I joined staff. Outside of school, I do research in the Berkeley Center for New Media on representation in American TV and cultivate my hobby of spamming my friends with pictures of cats I encounter. I'm psyched to be teaching this semester, and really excited to meet you all!
