Hello people! My name is Dominic, and I am a second year studying EECS. I am from Orange County, down in Southern California (Huntington Beach to be exact). I took CS10 fall semester of my freshmen year, with no previous coding experience, and have since fallen in love with coding. CS10 kickstarted my passion for programming and I am so excited to be able to provide that experience for all of you. Outside of school you can find me doing anything sports related. I love to rock climb, surf, snowboard, play baseball, basketball, and football, and am always down to run a game of spike ball. If anyone ever wants to send Berkeley Ironworks, my line is always open. I am super excited to have the opportunity to meet all of you.
