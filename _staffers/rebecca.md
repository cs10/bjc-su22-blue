Hi! I’m Rebecca and I’m a third year studying Business Administration and Computer Science. I’m from Potomac, Maryland and in my free time I enjoy reading, walking, and finding new restaurants! I’m really looking forward to being a reader for CS 10 this fall and this is one of my favorite classes at Cal. CS 10 helped me realize I love coding, and I hope it does for you all as well!
