Hello hello! I’m Yishu, a third-year Cognitive Science, CS double major. I took CS10 in Spring 2020, and I have been involved with the course ever since. This is my first time teaching CS10, and I am so excited to meet y’all! In my free time, I enjoy throwing themed dinner parties with my housemates, listening to music, working out, and traveling (pre-covid ;-;)
