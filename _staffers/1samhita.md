Hello hello:) I’m Samhita, a senior majoring in media studies and sociology, with a minor in education! I took CS10 my first semester at Cal and have been part of the family ever since! Outside of school, I’m working at a social media internship in healthcare communications, managing production at the Daily Cal, eating great Thai food in Berkeley, taking lots of naps, and, most importantly, working on logistics for CS10 this Fall! While I won't be teaching a specific section this semester, come drop by my office hours anytime for assignment help, advice, a space to vent, or anything else. So excited to meet y’all!
