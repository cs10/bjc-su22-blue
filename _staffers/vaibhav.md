I am a junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I started programming in high school but didn't really enjoy it until CS10 at CAL after which I took 61A and 61B. I am most fluent in Java and Python but also know the very basics of HTML, CSS, JS and C (which are for mostly resume purposes). I love playing soccer and am a huge Messi fan. Apart from that, I also love reading fiction (favorite is Harry Potter) and watching anime so if you have any anime stuff you want to talk about I am always here for it. This semester I would be working as a TA for CS10, taking MATH H104, COMPSCI 61C, MATH 113, and DATA C140. Outside of school, I hope to get a research position and get involved in some club projects.
