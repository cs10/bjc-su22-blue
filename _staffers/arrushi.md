Hey everyone! I am Arrushi Agarwal, a junior studying business and data science. I had a little coding experience before CS 10 but this class has really helped me with my future CS classes so I highly recommend it. I have been with CS 10 with over a year in the capacity of a student and an Academic Intern+. In my free time I like to cook, binge shows / movies (always up for a marvel marathon). Looking forward to a wonderful semester.
