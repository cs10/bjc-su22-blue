Hey there! I’m a rising Sophomore from India majoring in CS + CogSci, and I absolutely love teaching, arm-wrestling, and learning new abbreviations (can you guess what BJC stands for?) I’d love to chat about anything- especially Netflix series/restaurant recommendations- and am super stoked to be a part of the CS-10 family! See you in class:)
