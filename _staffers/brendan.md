Hello! Iâ€™m Brendan, a first year Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Education. I grew up in a small town in Massachusetts before coming to Berkeley for my undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science. I took CS10 way back in the spring of 2017 and was a TA my senior year. I left Cal after graduation to become a teacher and have spend the past two years teaching middle school science in Richmond and getting my masters degree from Loyola Marymount University. In my spare time, I love finding ways to travel for cheap and watching New England sports (Patriots, Red Sox and Celtics!).
