Hi, I’m Jake! I’m a third-year EECS major from a small town in the beautiful state of New Jersey (jealous??). I took CS10 my freshman fall semester. Being involved in the CS10 community has been one of the highlights of my time at Cal, so I’m super excited to work with y'all! Outside of CS, I enjoy guitar, bouldering, skateboarding (but I’m terrible at it), hiking, and breakfast foods. Looking forward to meeting all of you!
