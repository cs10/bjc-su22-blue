hey y’all!! I’m Sarah (she/her) a 3rd year computer science major. I learned how to code in CS10 during my freshman year at Cal and fell in love with programming and computing in general! I actually grew up in Texas and try to go home & visit my family as often as I can! Other than CS — I love sports (if you want to talk basketball, soccer, or F1 hmu), am working part-time this semester, and live to hike/swim (tbh anything in the sun and/or water)!
Stop by my office hours anytime for help, advice, just to chat or vent, album/artist/book recs — literally anything, I love to socialize. Looking forward to meeting and getting to know all of you!! (:
