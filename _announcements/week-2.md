<li> Make sure to fill out the Week 2 survey, which can be found on Ed. </li>
<li> If you’re unsatisfied with the section you’re currently enrolled in, you can still switch using the lab and discussion sheets! If all the sections you want to attend are full, email cs10@berkeley.edu with the subject “[CS10] Lab Enrollment Issue” or “[CS10] Discussion Enrollment Issue”! </li>
<li> If you have switched sections, or do not plan to keep attending synchronous lab or discussion, please un-enroll yourself on the wejoinins so other students can enroll. </li>
