<ul>
<li> We will be holding in-person lecture this Wednesday in our new lecture hall, Dwinelle 155. You can sign up to attend here: https://www.wejoinin.com/sheets/kdrgv  </li>
<li> Lab section capacities have been expanded for some sections which were fully enrolled on the WeJoinIn, but still had space for a few more students. Change your section here.  </li>
<li> If you don’t think you’ll finish Project 1 by Wednesday, you can use up to 2 slip days to finish with no late penalty. These will be automatically calculated based on your submission date.  </li>
<li> Prof. Hug has recorded the lecture for Wednesday already, it’s linked  below if you want to take a look before lab. </li>
