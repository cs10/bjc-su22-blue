This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AOTqtiqEgyYB3w33_C-WA9fn8hcIw4H9ENL2htZMyGA/edit?usp=sharing) contains the zoom links for lecture and remote discussion sections.
<ul>
<li>Welcome to CS10! The first lecture will be held 10-11am entirely remote at the usual lecture link (see above link). </li>
<li>Some TAs will be holding general office hours on the glade (Look out for the Squirtle sign!) 10am-12pm and 1-4pm on Wednesday, and 3-5pm on Thursday. This is a great way to meet some staff, ask any questions and voice any concerns you may have about the class and/or Cal in general. </li>
</ul>
